Would be very cool to do an example for a one host tick. For example the winter tick on moose! Use model to see whether moose density does affect tick prevlanenec (management says 1 moose per km2 is goal if higher tick population increases).

Anyway would need to find a bunch of sources on the winter tick.

Leal et al 2020 breaks up the one-host tick life cycle into eight stages
- female preovipostion
- female oviposition
- egg incubation
- larval-maturation (hardening)
- host-seeking larva
- feeding larva
- feed nymph,
- feeding adult
