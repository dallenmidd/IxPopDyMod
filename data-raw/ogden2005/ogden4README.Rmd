This page describes how we replicating the [Ogden et al. (2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020751905000044) *Ixodes scapularis* population dynamics model. 

## Differences with Odgen et al. (2005)

We were able to largely replicate Odgen et al.'s model directly with our model structure. Here are the few changes we had to make.
-   Ogden et al. has density-dependent reduction fecundity based on the number of adults on deer. We take fecundity (number of eggs produced) as a constant.
-   Ogden et al. handles host finding differently
    -   They give a weekly probability of host-finding. We translate this into a daily probability. 
    -   They use a curve (See Figure 3) to determine the probability an active tick quests based on temperature. We approximate these curves with Briere functions.

## Ogden et al. (2005) Figure 4

Here we show that even with this changes we are able to largely replicate the output of Odgen et al. (2005)'s model, starting here with Figure 4.

### Installation

Install the package needed with:

```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    pacman::p_load(gridExtra)
    library(IxPopDyMod)
    library(lubridate)
```

also install:

     install.packages("IxPopDyMod")

### Create the Tables

We used [PlotDigitizer](https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) to extract the observed larvae, nymphs, and adults from Figure 4.

- observed larvae `ol`
- observed nymphs `on`
- observed adults `oa`
- Ogden et al. predicted larvae `pl`
- Ogden et al. predicted larvae `pn`
- Ogden et al. predicted larvae `pa`

```{r}
ol <- read_csv('make_ogden_fig4/observed_larvae.csv',
               col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group = 'ol')
on <- read_csv('make_ogden_fig4/observed_nymphs.csv',
               col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group = 'on')
oa <- read_csv('make_ogden_fig4/observed_adults.csv',
               col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group = 'oa')

pl <- read_csv('make_ogden_fig4/predicted_larvae.csv',
               col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group = 'pl')
pn <- read_csv('make_ogden_fig4/predicted_nymphs.csv',
               col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group = 'pn')
pa <- read_csv('make_ogden_fig4/predicted_adults.csv',
               col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group = 'pa')
```

### Looking At What This Does

`col_names = c('jday', 'n')) %>% mutate(group =' '`

`col_names` specifies what columns to make with the data. Here, `jday` (Julian Date) and `n` () are what we want to assign to the data already in the `.csv`

`%>% mutate(group = '')` is saying mutate, or create a new table while preserving the old one, and add on the column group that labels these rows as on of the variable names (`on`, `pn`, ect.).

### Putting Together The Tibbles Into One

```{r}
    # merge all data
    ogden_fig4_data <- rbind(pl, pn, pa, ol, on, oa) %>%
      arrange(jday, group) %>%
      mutate(jday = round(jday))
```

`rbind` takes all the groups and "glues" them together so they end up in the in the same columns : jday, n, group. Then this is put into the variable `df` (for data frame).

`arrange` takes the data and arranges the data in the columns by `jday` from least to greatest and then by `group`.

lastly, we `mutate` `jday` so that the day is rounded to a whole number

### Run our version of the model

Now we run our version of the model to get the predicted number of ticks.

```{r}
output <- run(ogden2005)

questing <- output %>%
  # look at data after the model has run for a while and stabilized
  mutate(post_eq_jday = day - 365 * 6) %>%
  filter(post_eq_jday > 0,
         post_eq_jday < 365 * 2,
         process == 'a')
```

```{r}
ogden_sampling_days <- ogden_fig4_data %>%
  pull(jday) %>%
  unique()

to_merge <- questing %>%
  filter(post_eq_jday %in% ogden_sampling_days) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  mutate(pop_fraction = pop/sum(pop)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  transmute(jday = post_eq_jday,
            n = pop_fraction * 7, # multiply by constant just to scale so similar to Ogden
            group = str_c(process, age_group))

merged_fig4 <- rbind(ogden_fig4_data, to_merge)

merged4a <- merged_fig4 %>%
  filter(group %in% c('pl', 'al')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(jday, n, shape = group, linetype = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Day of year") +
  ylab("Questing larvae")

merged4b <- merged_fig4 %>%
  filter(group %in% c('pn', 'an')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(jday, n, shape = group, linetype = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  xlab("Day of year") +
  ylab("Questing nymphs")

merged4c <- merged_fig4 %>%
  filter(group %in% c('pa', 'aa')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(jday, n, shape = group, linetype = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  xlab("Day of year") +
  ylab("Questing adults")

grid.arrange(merged4a, merged4b, merged4c)


```
