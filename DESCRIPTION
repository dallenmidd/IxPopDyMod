Description: Specify, run, and then 
    visualize and analyze the results of Ixodidae (hard-bodied ticks) population
    dynamics models. Such population dynamics models exist in the literature, 
    but the source code to run them is not always available. We wanted to 
    provide an easy way for these models to be written and shared.
